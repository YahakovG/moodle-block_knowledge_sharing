#Knowledge Sharing Block

###TL;DR
*Knowledge Sharing Block* enables the sharing of the content of a selected sub-tree of categoriesa and courses across the whole site by simple drag-drop.

###Not That Long Really...
With *Knoledge Sharing Block* one can separte a sub-tree of categories and courses as resource/activity storage for all the site. The first step is to select on the settings page the category that will act as root. After that, when one editing a course section, the *Knowledge Sharing Block* will show on the top-left side of the page showing all the reources/activities under that category. Those resurces/activities can be organized in tree by the category/course flow or using tags that assigned to them. The desired resource/activity can be dragged to the section of the course and shared easily.
